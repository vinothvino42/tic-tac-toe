# React Tic Tac Toe

A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with ReactJS that demonstrates the use of functional components, props, and state management using the useState hook.

- Interactive Gameplay: Players can click on empty cells to place their marks. The board automatically updates after each move.
- Win/Draw Logic: The game includes logic to detect winning conditions (three marks in a row) or a draw (board full without a winner).
- Restart Option: Once a game is finished, players can restart the game with a single button click.

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
